The **Menu Project** is designed to create a dynamic list of menu items with filter buttons at the top. This project builds upon concepts learned in a previous JavaScript course, specifically focusing on how to add items dynamically without manually copying and pasting HTML markup. The key feature of the project is the filter functionality, which allows users to click on a filter button to display only the items that match the selected category. The main emphasis of this project will be on implementing this filtering feature effectively.
